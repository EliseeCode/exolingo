# Exolingo
Exolingo is a website to help anyone learn anything with a flashCard system optimised for the use in a classroom.
## Exolingo's description
Today, ExoLingo is a fun online platform for learning foreign language vocabulary for teachers and learners at level A1, A2 and B1.

The learner chooses the cards and the type of exercise he wishes to practice among those generated by the platform. This is responsible for reminding the learner (at the right time) when and which cards to revise in order to optimize their vocabulary memorization.

More than 35,000 illustrated cards of the basic vocabulary (in more than 10 languages) are already in use on the platform. All users (learners and teachers) have the possibility to create their own vocabulary lists and to share them.

200,000 exercises are carried out each month by more than 2,000 pupils in some thirty countries.

### Exolingo Algorythme
"Spaced repetition is a technique of learning that is to be questioned (or self-examine) the less often than the control issue.
This method starts from an apparently obvious observation: human memory is not perfectly reliable and we often forget what we have learned. On the other hand, forgetting is rarely total, and if we learn again what we have already learned, we forget less quickly. If we manage to revise a notion every time we are on the verge of forgetting it, we realize that we need to revise the notion less and less often. By working in this way, we save time compared to the hypothesis of non-spaced repetitions while remaining efficient. ‚Äù
Wikipedia

The Exolingo algorithm calculate the optimal time of revision by taking into account the difficulty of the word (difference between the word in the original language and in the target language) and the types of games played in the past and the learner's attendance.

### Exolingo learning principle
The platform is based on certain principles.
 
* We learn best what we have chosen to learn and how to learn it.
* It is the repetition of the word that generates its long-term acquisition.
* The alternation of revision - verification allows a good mental anchoring.
* The sequence of reviews depends on:
* The learner's abilities
* The difficulty of the word
* Punctuality the review
* student attendance.
* A word must be learned in its context.
* The creation of content by the learner promotes his learning.
* People learn better through play.
## Goal of this repo
This repo's goal is to renovate the code of the web site www.exolingo.com with a laravel or AdonisJs framework and to propose a way for school to setup to have their own version of exoLingo on their server.
The original website is writen with PHP and mysql. It is a personal project made without any framework and needs structure to be maintained and developed.
## Steps in the developpement of the project
- [ ] Importing the code of the actual website
- [ ] Choosing a stack for the developpement of the new version
- [ ] Start to code.
